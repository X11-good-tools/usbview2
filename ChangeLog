version 0.1a
	- First alpha release of Usbview2 in sourceforge.net
 
version 0.2a
	- Now Usbview2 accepts command-line options. Try `usbview2 --help' for infos.

version 0.3a
	- With activated refresh force open the error dialog only one time. If the
	  file changes, than open the dialog once again.
	- If no read access to the devices file, then clear the tree and the notebook
	  too (and change the status bar)

version 0.4a
	- Added support for Libusb (/dev/bus/usb)
        - New command line options (see --help)
        - The usbfs is marked as deprecated in the kernel, so the default setup uses
          Libusb. If usbfs is desired, then use the option '--with-usbfs' when running
          configure (see --help for another options)
