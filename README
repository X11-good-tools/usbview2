About Usbview2
--------------

USBView2 is based on USBView (see at sourceforge.net for more infos about this
application). The differences between this two applications is basically the 
graphical library. Usbview2 uses actually the version 2 of Gtk+. 

The application was created under Debian stable (Etch - 4.1.1-21) 
with the version 2.8.20-7 of Gtk+2.

If you have some questions or commentaries about USBView2 please send me an email. 
Thanks.
