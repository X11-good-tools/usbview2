About Usbview2
--------------

USBView2 is based on USBView (see at sourceforge.net for more infos about this
application). The differences between this two applications is basically the 
graphical library. Usbview2 uses actually the version 2 of Gtk+. 

The application was created under Debian stable (Etch - 4.1.1-21) 
with the version 2.8.20-7 of Gtk+2.

The version 0.4a includes the support for Libusb ('usbfs' is marked as
deprecated in the mainline kernel). For displaying the devices we use a similar
file than 'lsusb', but instead of an 'ids' we use a XML. The Python script under
./src/xml creates the XML from the 'ids'.
