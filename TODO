@TODO - Usbview2
----------------

- The menu bar is incomplete (only the exit and about options are working)
- configure.in: 
    - Check for basename() and the corresponding header file
- The device speed is displayed incorrectly (Unknown). The detection needs 
  root permissions (ioctl() operation with '+w'). We can probably
  try to get this info from the sysfs, but it's just a workaround and a
  little complicated.
